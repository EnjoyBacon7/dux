# Valorization Model & License

Dux is not just a technical project; it is an **Open Innovation** initiative aiming to establish a **Digital Common**.

## Our Valorization Strategy

In accordance with the principles of digital commons, we have chosen to maximize the **social and technical impact** of Dux rather than restricting its usage. Our strategy rests on three pillars:

1.  **Openness**: The code and documentation are accessible to all to foster the dissemination of knowledge.
2.  **Reciprocity (ShareAlike)**: We guarantee that any improvement made to Dux will benefit the entire community.
3.  **Community**: We encourage contribution to sustain the resource beyond the initial team.

## 📜 The License: CC BY-SA 4.0

We have placed the entire project (code, design, documentation) under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)** license.

This choice aligns with the philosophy of **Free Software** and **Copyleft**: it preserves user freedoms while ensuring the long-term free nature of the project.

### Your Rights (What you can do)

Under this license, you are free to:

* **Share**: Copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
* **Adapt**: Remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

### Your Obligations (What you must respect)

To ensure the vitality of this digital common, usage is subject to the following conditions:

1.  **Attribution (BY)**: You must give appropriate credit to Dux, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
2.  **ShareAlike (SA)**: If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions **under the same license** (CC BY-SA). This is the mechanism that protects the project against proprietary closure.

## Why this choice?

Unlike a permissive license (such as MIT or BSD) which would allow the code to be closed off in derivative products, the **ShareAlike** clause of the CC BY-SA ensures that Dux will always remain a public good accessible to all.

It is comparable to "reciprocal" licenses in the software world (like the GPL), thereby fostering a virtuous ecosystem where every user is a potential contributor.

## How to credit us?

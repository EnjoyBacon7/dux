# Welcome to Dux

**Dux** is more than just a job board. It is your personal, AI-powered career coach designed to bridge the gap between your resume and your dream job.

By combining official market data from **[France Travail](https://www.francetravail.fr/)** with advanced **Artificial Intelligence**, Dux reads and understands your profile just like a recruiter would—but in milliseconds.

---

## How It Works

You might wonder how Dux determines if you are a good match. Here is the process, simplified:

1.  **Smart Extraction:** When you upload your CV, Dux doesn't just store the file. It extracts and "reads" the text to understand your actual skills, experiences, and nuances.
2.  **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike old systems that just look for matching keywords (e.g., "Python"), Dux understands context. It knows that "Project Manager" requires leadership skills even if the word "Leader" isn't written explicitly.
3.  **Instant Comparison:** Because your profile is securely digitized, Dux can compare you against thousands of offers instantly without you needing to re-upload your CV for every single click.

## Quick Start

1.  **Sign Up:** Create an account in seconds or use **LinkedIn** for one-click access.
2.  **One-Time Upload:** Go to your **Profile** and upload your PDF resume. Dux will digitize it immediately.
3.  **Check Your Health:** Look at your **CV Score** to see if your resume is ready for the market.
4.  **Analyze & Apply:** Browse jobs and hit **"Analyze"** to get instant feedback before you apply.
5.  **Profile Match:** Jobs that may be convenient to you are shown with justifications.

## The "CV Health" Score

Before applying, you need to know if your resume is strong on its own.
Once logged in, the Dashboard gives you a **Quality Score** (0-100) based on 5 pillars:

* **Completeness:** Did you forget contact info or a summary?
* **Impact:** Do you use numbers and results to describe your success?
* **Clarity:** Is your layout easy to read for humans and robots?
* **Skills Relevance:** Are your skills aligned with current market trends?
* **Experience Quality:** Are your job descriptions detailed enough?

> **Pro Tip:** Check the "Recommendations" list below your score. Fixing these small issues can significantly boost your visibility to recruiters.

## Profile Matches

Don't want to search manually? Let Dux come to you.

Immediately after analyzing your CV, Dux activates its recommendation engine to populate the **"Profile Match"** section on your dashboard. These are not random ads; they are opportunities where your profile already scores highly. You can tell him what you are looking for exactly and it will show you the top 5 most suitable offers.

**Why trust these suggestions?**
Unlike standard job alerts, Dux provides **Justifications** for every suggestion. It tells you exactly *why* it picked this role for you.

## Profile Hub

The Profile Hub is your command center for perfection. It goes beyond the simple score by using two types of AI technologies:

1.  **Semantic Analysis (LLM):** Checks the *meaning* of your words. Are your sentences impactful? Is your vocabulary professional?
2.  **Visual Analysis (VLM):** "Looks" at your CV like a human eye. It analyzes your layout, font usage, margins, and readability.

Dux provides specific feedback to correct both the **content** and the **design** of your resume, maximizing your chances of passing both automated filters and human recruiters.

## Chatbot

Dux also provides an interactive chatbot that can help you save time.

1.  **Cover letter generator:** It checks your CV and the selected offer and generates a suitable cover letter that will boost your application.
2.  **AI advisor:** Whenever you are lost or need guidance, ask the assistant; it considers the offer and your CV to provide the best answers.
